> Deterministic simulation of AI agent attack scenarios for governance, compliance, and control engineering.

**Created by [NeoXFortress LLC](https://neoxfortress.com) — AI Agent Accountability Infrastructure for Regulated Contractors**

---

## Why This Exists

AI agents are making decisions inside defense contractors. They call tools, process sensitive data, and interact with external services. When an agent goes wrong — prompt injection, data exfiltration, privilege escalation — most organizations have no evidence of what happened.

This lab simulates those failures. Every attack is detected and blocked by the policy engine. Every blocked action produces a **signed [Agent Accountability Receipt](https://github.com/NeoXFortress/agent-accountability-receipt)** — tamper-evident proof of what was attempted and what was stopped.

**This lab shows the attack. The receipt proves you caught it.**

## Attack Scenarios

| Scenario | MITRE ATLAS | What Happens | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Prompt Injection** | [AML.T0051](https://atlas.mitre.org/techniques/AML.T0051) | Malicious instructions embedded in a document trick the agent into exfiltrating data and disabling logging | 4 injection patterns detected, 2 tool calls blocked |
| **Data Exfiltration** | [AML.T0048.002](https://atlas.mitre.org/techniques/AML.T0048) | Agent attempts to send CUI-marked data to Gmail, a .ru domain, and an external file share | 3 exfiltration vectors blocked by content + domain policy |
| **Privilege Escalation** | [AML.T0044](https://atlas.mitre.org/techniques/AML.T0044) | Agent attempts shell execution, firewall modification, admin account creation, and key vault access | 4 unauthorized tool calls denied by allowlist |

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NeoXFortress/neox-agent-risk-lab.git
cd neox-agent-risk-lab
python3 run_all.py
```

No external dependencies. No API keys. Pure Python 3.10+.

## Example: Signed Receipt (Prompt Injection Scenario)

Every scenario produces a schema-valid Agent Accountability Receipt. Here's the compliance verdict and integrity block from the prompt injection receipt:

```json
{
  "compliance": {
    "verdict": "non_compliant",
    "assessed_by": "engine_rule_set",
    "violated_controls": ["SC.L2-3.13.1", "SI.L2-3.14.1"],
    "risk_score": 8.0,
    "framework": "CMMC L2",
    "notes": "Agent attempted to follow injected instructions. 4 patterns detected. Tool calls blocked."
  },
  "integrity": {
    "hash_chain": {
      "alg": "sha256",
      "chain": [
        { "step_id": "step-001", "hash": "a3f8c1...", "prev_hash": "000000..." },
        { "step_id": "step-002", "hash": "7b2e4d...", "prev_hash": "a3f8c1..." },
        { "step_id": "step-003", "hash": "e91f0a...", "prev_hash": "7b2e4d..." },
        { "step_id": "step-004", "hash": "d4c7b2...", "prev_hash": "e91f0a..." }
      ],
      "final_hash": "d4c7b2..."
    },
    "signature": {
      "type": "hmac_sha256",
      "signed_payload": "canonical_receipt_plus_final_hash"
    }
  }
}
```

Full receipts are in `outputs/receipt-*.json`. Schema: [Agent Accountability Receipt v0.1.1](https://github.com/NeoXFortress/agent-accountability-receipt/blob/main/schema.json).

## Output Files

After running, the `outputs/` directory contains:

```
outputs/
├── execution-log.json                    ← Structured event log (all scenarios)
├── receipt-prompt_injection.json         ← Signed receipt: injection attack
├── receipt-exfiltration.json             ← Signed receipt: CUI exfiltration attempt
├── receipt-privilege_escalation.json     ← Signed receipt: unauthorized tool access
├── report.md                             ← Agent Exploit Report (Markdown)
├── report.html                           ← Agent Exploit Report (styled HTML)
└── evidence-manifest.json                ← Evidence pack manifest
```

## Architecture

**1-agent sequential pipeline.** No multi-agent coordination needed — deterministic attack simulations with policy enforcement.

```
Document/Input → Policy Engine → Tool Wrapper → Decision (ALLOW/DENY/REQUIRES_HUMAN) → Log → Receipt
```

### Components

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `policy_engine.py` | Tool-level access control: allowlist enforcement, domain blocking, CUI content gates, prompt injection scanner (7 patterns) |
| `scenario_runner.py` | Executes 3 attack scenarios, produces structured JSON logs + signed receipts |
| `report_generator.py` | Builds Markdown + HTML exploit report with MITRE ATLAS mapping and CMMC control coverage |
| `run_all.py` | One-command runner: scenarios + report |

### Policy Engine Decisions

| Decision | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `ALLOW` | Tool call permitted under current policy | `read_document` on internal file |
| `DENY` | Tool call blocked — logged with rule ID and reason | `send_email` to `.ru` domain |
| `REQUIRES_HUMAN` | Tool call paused pending human approval | `send_email` to approved domain |

## CMMC L2 Control Coverage

| Control | Domain | Scenarios |
|---|---|---|
| SC.L2-3.13.1 | Boundary Protection | Exfiltration, Prompt Injection |
| SC.L2-3.13.2 | CUI Flow Enforcement | Exfiltration |

| AC.L2-3.1.1 | Access Control | Exfiltration, Privilege Escalation |
| AC.L2-3.1.2 | Access Control Enforcement | Privilege Escalation |
| AU.L2-3.3.1 | System Auditing | Privilege Escalation |

- PDF export for evidence packs

**v1.2** (Planned)
- Asymmetric signature support (Ed25519) for multi-party verification
- OWASP LLM Top 10 scenario coverage
- Custom scenario builder — define your own attack vectors via YAML
